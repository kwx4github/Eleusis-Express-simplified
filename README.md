It is simplified by John Golden to a "new" game called Eleusis Express:

The game is actually a good simulation of scientific methods and how scientists are discovering the details of the natural phenomenon.

This project aims to prepare the documentation for a further simplified version of Eleusis Express to

1. assist the players to understand the game flow, and
2. assist the host to debrief about how the game is related to:
	- scientific method, and
 	- inductive logic
	- confirmation bias
